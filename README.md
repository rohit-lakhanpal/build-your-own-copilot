<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- PLACEHOLDER FOR YOUTUBE VIDEO -->

It's fascinating coming across this article titled ["Democratizing AI"](https://news.microsoft.com/features/democratizing-ai/) from 2016 by Microsoft, where the seeds were already being sown for a world where AI technologies are accessible and beneficial to everyone, not a luxury confined to the domains of developers and data scientists. Even back then, Microsoft said:
> *"It's not about having AI that beats humans in games; it's about helping everyone achieve more — humans and machines working together to make the world a better place."* 

Fast-forward to today, and we witness a monumental push to integrate AI into every possible application, leading to the emergence of the "Co-Pilot" concept.

This project contains resources and examples to help you as you **build your own Co-Pilot** applications that use modern AI to assist with complex tasks.

## What is a Co-Pilot?

> *"The concept of a Co-Pilot is an application that uses modern AI to assist with complex, cognitive tasks."* - Kevin Scott

Through this **Build Your Own Copilot** project, we've collected resources aimed at enabling you to Explore, Envision & GTM with your own Co-Pilot applications.

## The Gen AI Buzz

The LLMS/Foundation models have brought about a paradigm shift in AI capabilities, particularly in two key areas: `Completions` and `Embeddings`. 

The `Completions` capability of LLMS/Foundation models has revolutionized the way we interact with AI. This feature allows the model to generate creative and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. It’s like having a conversation with the model, where you provide an input and the model generates a meaningful continuation. This capability is not just limited to conversations, but extends to generating stories, code, essays, and more. The models have been trained on a diverse range of internet text, enabling them to handle a wide array of topics with ease.

On the other hand, “Vector Search” and “Embeddings” are powerful capabilities. Instead of merely matching keywords in a query, these technologies permit the model to grasp the semantic meaning behind a given input, thereby facilitating more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### Enabling Everyone

The advent of Generation AI is nothing short of transformational, representing a paradigm shift in the integration and application of AI across various domains. It heralds a future where artificial intelligence is not merely a tool but a collaborative partner, capable of reshaping industries, fostering innovation, and catalyzing unprecedented growth and development. Gen AI embodies the culmination of advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and cognitive computing, collectively ushering in an era of limitless possibilities and solutions.

For businesses to truly leverage the full spectrum of opportunities offered by Gen AI, it is crucial to cultivate an environment where everyone is empowered and enabled to contribute. This includes the **`hackers`**, who can push the boundaries of what is technically possible; the **`hipsters`**, who bring design thinking and creativity to forge user-centric solutions; and the **`hustlers`**, who drive the vision and execution to bring innovations to market. By embracing diversity and fostering a collaborative ecosystem that values the unique skills and perspectives of each individual, businesses can unlock the true potential of Gen AI and drive forward the frontier of what is possible in this exciting new era.
